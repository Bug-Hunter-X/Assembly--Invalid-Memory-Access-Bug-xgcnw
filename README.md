This repository contains an example of an uncommon code error in assembly language: accessing memory at an invalid address. The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version.  The bug occurs due to lack of proper bounds checking before accessing memory locations. This can result in program crashes or unpredictable behavior. The solution involves adding checks to ensure that memory accesses are within valid bounds before execution.
